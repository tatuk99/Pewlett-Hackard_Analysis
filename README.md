# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to look at the data of retiring employees at Pewlett Hackard. Managers are trying to determine how many employees will be leaving the company soon, in order to prepare for a "silver tsunami". This analysis examines the number of retiring employees per title, and and a breakdown of employees who are eligible for a mentorship program (employees who are on track to retire are eligible to mentor others in the company).

## Results
- A very large chunk of employees will be retiring soon. Most of these roles are senior roles, and primarily senior engineering roles. Roles like these will be more difficult to find new people for, as they require far more extensive knowledge than many roles below.
- Those employees who are eligible for the mentorship program, are also primarily senior roles. This is a great initiative for the company, because knowledge will be passed on to new talent from employees who are well-versed in their positions.
- If we include data from earlier in the module in order to determine the number of employees who are eligible for retirement throughout the entire company, those retiring comprise 30% of the company. This is a large chunk of people.
- Over 60% of retiring roles are senior positions.

## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

  72,458 roles will need to be filled overall - a replacement of 30% of the company.
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

  Not quite - really, not close at all. There are just 1,549 employees who are qualified to mentor the next generation. 

Although the mentorship idea is a good one, what may be helpful for the company would be to put their employees through outside bootcamps, along with hiring new people with extensive knowledge. Another interesting approach might be to encourage the current mentorship-ready staff to create some sort of courses for future generations to follow, some sort of blueprint that holds important information that's essential to the success of the company.

An additional query I would go through to deepen this analysis, would be to look at employees who are currently in senior roles who may have been at the company for a long time. How many of those are there, and how far off are they from the soon-to-retire staff as far as their knowledge? Maybe with a slight push they may also be eligible to mentor future generations.

Also - I think it may be interesting to see where older and more successful employees were hired from. Is there any sort of correlation as far as schooling or previous companies they were at? For recruiting efforts, this may be an interesting perspective for the company to hire on new talent.
